# Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Playstore Dataset

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is a crucial component of data science which allows you to develop the gist of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them.Ultimately, EDA is important because it allows the investigator to make critical decisions about what is interesting to pursue and what probably isnâ€™t worth following up on and thus building a hypothesis using the relationships between variables.

EDA is also very iterative since we first make assumptions based on our first exploratory visualizations, then build some models. We then make visualizations of the model results and tune our models.

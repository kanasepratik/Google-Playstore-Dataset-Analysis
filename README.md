# Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Playstore Dataset

- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is a crucial component of data science which allows you to develop the gist of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them.Ultimately, EDA is important because it allows the investigator to make critical decisions about what is interesting to pursue and what probably isnâ€™t worth following up on and thus building a hypothesis using the relationships between variables.

- EDA is also very iterative since we first make assumptions based on our first exploratory visualizations, then build some models. We then make visualizations of the model results and tune our models.


## About the Dataset

Here, we explore using data science and machine learning techniques on data retrieved from one such avenue on the internet, the Google Play Store.
The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains details of the various mobile application.This information is scraped from the Google Play Store.
The features of the dataset are as follows:
The columns of the dataset are as follows:

1. App (Name)
2. Category (App)
3. Rating (App)
4. Reviews (User)
5. Size (App)
6. Installs (App)
7. Type (Free/Paid)
8. Price (App)
9. Content Rating (Everyone/Teenager/Adult)
10. Genres (Detailed Category)
11. Last Updated (App)
12. Current Version (App)
13. Android Version (Support)

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market!


## Objectives of Exploring the Data

- The main goal of analyzing the data is to understand the parameters which can impact on the rating of the application.
- Analyzing the apps with largest popularity
- Analyzing the apps with largest size.
- Analyzing the factors which can vary the rating of the applications.
- Cleaning the data acoording the machine learning model. 
- Understanding the feature which can contribute more in predicting the target variables.
- Handling missing values, performing feature engineering techniques.

## EDA Approach
- Understanding the variables
- Cleaning the dataset
- Analyzing relationships between variables
